  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: May 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>This application allows users to record, transcribe, and summarize meetings. We value your privacy and aim to be transparent about how your data is handled.</p>

    <li>Meeting name (provided by you)</li>
    <li>Email address (used to send the summary)</li>
    <li>Transcription and summary (generated during the session)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>None of this data is stored permanently.</strong> We do not use a database or persistent storage for recordings, transcripts, or summaries.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>All data is processed in-memory or temporarily saved to disk only for the purpose of transcription and summarization. Temporary files are deleted immediately after processing.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>This app uses OpenAI services to transcribe and summarize your audio, and Google's Gmail API (if authorized) to send the results to your email. Your data is never shared beyond these purposes.</p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
